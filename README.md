# genomic_seg_plots
genomic_seg_plots is a short pipeline to build genomic plots from genbank (short) genomes, displaying [NCBI seg](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwjXhqnZxPLwAhXIm-AKHXmoAp4QFjAAegQIBBAD&url=ftp%3A%2F%2Fftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpub%2Fseg%2Fseg%2F&usg=AOvVaw2s1FT-lfX5HmgPegjJk2tB) analysis output, and genomic features. It's main objective is to automatize and easily locate simple sequences detected by NCBI seg.
